# KMeans_Clustering

In the downloaded files, in the data folder, there is a dictionary with informations about documents containing the following keys:

• id-document ids;

• vectors - document vectors with size 100 from the doc2vec algorithm; 

• group - document groups (integers from 0 to 9).

Here, I am creating a cluster_articles function.
